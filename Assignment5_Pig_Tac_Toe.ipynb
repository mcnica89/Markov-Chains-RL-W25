        "## Object of the game\n",
        "Players place X's and O's on a 4 by 4 grid and try to get 3 of their symbols in a line (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Unlike Tic-Tac-Toe, the game does *not* end when the first 3-in-a-line happens. Instead, the game is played until the board is filled, and any 3-in-a-line is worth 1 victory point. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins. A single X or O may contribute to scoring multiple victory points. (For example, having 4 X's in a row effectively counts as 2 victory points). If both players have the same number of victory points at the end of the game, they rejoice in their shared victory.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to place Xs and Os\n",
        "On a turn, a player does the following with their symbol: (Rules described for the X player below, the O player is identical with the symbol changed)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 1.** Place \"potential\" X: Choose an empty square on the board and place a \"potential\" X there.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 2.** Decide whether to play it safe and \"BANK\" or to take a risk and \"ROLL\":\n",
        "  - If they choose to \"BANK\", all the potential X's from this turn become permanent X's on the board. Then the turn is over and it becomes the other players turn.\n",
        "  - If they choose to \"ROLL\", they roll a d6.\n",
        "    - On a dice outcome of 3,4,5,6 they succeed their roll and go back to Step 1 and can place another potential X, and then decide whether to ROLL/BANK again.\n",
        "    - On a dice outcome of 1 or 2, they fail their roll and they lose all their potential Xs from this turn, which are removed from the board. It then becomes the other player's turn.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Special Starting Rule\n",
        "The first player determined randomly (e.g., by a coin flip or die roll). To offset the first player advantage, the player who plays second begins the game with one square chosen at random already filled in.   \n",
        "\n",
        "## Game End Condition\n",
        "The game ends when all 16 squares are filled, at which point victory points are counted. In the computer implentation, to avoid games going on infinetly long, there is also a maximum game length limit imposed (normally 64 rounds max). If this maximum limit is hit, the game instantly ends and the winner is the player with most victory points at this time."
