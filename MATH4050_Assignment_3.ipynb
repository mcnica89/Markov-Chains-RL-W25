        "\n",
        "## Intro to Easy 21\n",
        "\n",
        "Easy21 is a mathematical game that is similar to blackjack. In this problem, you will find the optimal strategy in a version of Easy 21.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Easy21 is played with a custom deck of cards. Some of the cards are *negative* and some cards are *positive*. The deck is given by a numpy array, e.g. ```deck = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6,-7,-8,-9,-10])```. This example 30 card deck is the \"traditional\" deck that Easy21 is played with.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For this problem, we will play Easy21 from an \"infinite deck\" (or equivlently drawing cards \"with replacement\"). This means you can pretend each new card is taken from a new deck or equivalently its like a dice roll from a 30 sided dice. (So the odds of each card coming out are independent of all previous cards that came out)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Like in Blackjack, in Easy21 your objective is to have the highest possible total of your cards without going bust by exceeding $>21$/going $\\leq 0$. You can either \"stick\" (aks \"stay\" or \"stop\") at your current total or \"hit\" to get another card.\n",
        "\n",
        "The order of operations to play the game are as follows, divided into Four Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The dealer and the player are both dealt a single starting card faceup from the deck. The *absolute value* of this card is their starting value (so negative cards are still a valid starting point). The dealer's starting card is visible to the player.\n",
        "2. The player goes first and chooses to hit or stick until either: a.) They either go bust by having a sum $>21$ or $\\leq 0$. Or else: b.) They choose to \"stick\" at some point.\n",
        "  - If they go bust here the player immediatly loses. (Player reward -1)\n",
        "3. If the player has not gone bust, and chooses to stick, then the dealer takes their turn. The dealer always follows the *hit-below-17 policy*; they stick on any sum of 17 or greater and hit on 16 and below.\n",
        "  - If the dealer goes bust at this point, the player immediatly wins (Player reward +1)\n",
        "4. If the dealer has not gone bust and stops, then the dealer's total is compared to the player's total.\n",
        "   - If the players total is higher, then the player wins the bet (Player reward +1)\n",
        "   - If the dealers total is higher, then the dealer wins the bet (Player reward -1)\n",
        "   - If they are tied, then it is a draw and neither player wins. (Player reward 0)"

        "\n",
        "Recall the gambler's problem where the gambler would keep placing bets until they hit a bankroll of $x=0$ or some target $x=n$ where the win probability for each even-odds bet was $p_{win}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this problem, instead of betting until either $n$ or $0$ is reached, the gambler will bet for a fixed number of rounds $t_{max}$. On each round they must bet at least $\\$ 1$, and can bet any amount up to and including their entire bankroll. (Exception: if they ever get to a bankroll of $x=\\$0$ they are broke and can no longer bet. They stay broke for all future rounds.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Your job is to find the optimal betsize that maximizes *the expected Gambler's total money* at the end of all the betting rounds, for any given bankroll size $x$ and any number of rounds left $t$. *Example*: When $t=0$, there are no bets left and the value is simply however many dollars you have on the table ```v[0,x]=x``` for every $x$.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make the problem fit onto a finite computer a bankroll maximum $n_{max}$ is imposed and the player's bankroll will always be $0\\leq x \\leq n_{max}$. Anytime a bet would cause the player to exceed this maximum, the excess is immediatly transfered to a savings account for the player. The player can never gamble with funds from the savings account, but is rewarded for these saving account dollars as regular dollars. *Example:* If $p_{win}=100\\%$, then the optimal strategy is to always bet the maximum amount. When the table maximum is $n_{max} = 7$, then the value of $t=2$ and $x=\\$5$ is ```v[2,5]=17``` because their  bets will proceed as follows:\n",
